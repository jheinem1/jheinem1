        <p>
          I am a software engineering graduate from ASU who likes building with
          TypeScript, Java, Python, and C. Most of my project work focuses on
          practical APIs and maintainable implementation details.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy turning vague ideas into solid interfaces and systems that
          teams can evolve over time.
